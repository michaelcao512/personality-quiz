# Bunny Personality Quiz

This is a Next.js project that features a Bunny Personality Quiz, designed to help users discover what type of bunny breed they are based on their innate decision-making styles. Upon completing the quiz, users will receive a corresponding bunny archetype, providing a fun and engaging experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the quiz in action. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the personality quiz from the Taiwan Expo, focusing on how innate decision-making processes can align with different bunny breeds.
